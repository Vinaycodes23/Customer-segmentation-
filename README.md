## Project Description
Customer segmentation is a strategic approach that divides a company's customer base into distinct groups based on similar characteristics, behaviors, or preferences. This project implements machine learning techniques to automatically identify customer segments, allowing businesses to:

- Create personalized marketing strategies
- Improve customer retention
- Optimize product offerings
- Enhance customer experience
- Increase profitability

## Dataset
The analysis uses the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset, which includes the following features:
- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
- Gender: Customer's gender
- Age: Customer's age
- Annual Income (k$): Customer's annual income in thousands of dollars
- Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned to customers based on purchasing behavior and spending nature

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Vinaycodes23/Customer-segmentation-.git
cd Customer-segmentation-

# Create and activate virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Customer_Segmentation.ipynb
```
2. Run the cells in sequence to reproduce the analysis
3. Modify parameters as needed for your own customer data

## Methodology
The project follows these key steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing customer attributes and relationships
3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for segmentation
4. **K-means Clustering**: Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
5. **Cluster Analysis**: Characterizing each customer segment based on their attributes
6. **Visualization**: Creating visual representations of the customer segments

## Results
The analysis identifies distinct customer segments based on spending patterns and income levels. Each segment represents a group of customers with similar characteristics, which allows for tailored marketing strategies.

Key insights include:
- Identification of high-value customer segments
- Recognition of potential groups for targeted promotions
- Understanding of the relationship between income and spending behavior
